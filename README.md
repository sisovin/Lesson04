# LEARNING PYTHON PROGRAMMING

Python programming refers to the process of writing, testing, and debugging code in the Python programming language. Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability with its use of significant whitespace. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more, due to its simplicity and versatility. Its extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages make it a popular choice for developers of all skill levels.

## How to check the Python version

1. type: py -3 --version
2. type: python --version
3. type: python press Enter -> go to Python Repl // Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
4. type: py press Enter -> go to Python Repl // Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop

## How to Run Python

In both Spyder and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), there are multiple ways to run or debug a Python file. Here's a breakdown for each:

### Spyder:

1. **Run Button**: Click the green play button in the toolbar to run the current script.
2. **F5 Shortcut**: Press F5 to run the current script.
3. **Run Configurations**: Set up different run configurations for different scripts or purposes.
4. **Interactive Console**: Run commands or scripts directly in the IPython console.
5. **Debugging**: Click the bug icon to start debugging. You can set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, etc.

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

1. **Run Button**: Click the green play button in the top-right corner to run the current script.
2. **Run Without Debugging**: Use the `Ctrl+F5` shortcut to run the script without entering the debugger.
3. **Integrated Terminal**: Run the script manually from the integrated terminal using the `python filename.py` command.
4. **Run and Debug Sidebar**: Use the "Run and Debug" sidebar to start debugging, with options to add configurations for different run or debug scenarios.
5. **Code Runner Extension**: If installed, you can use the Code Runner extension to run scripts with a play button in the editor or with a right-click context menu on the file tree, then select Run Python file in terminal.
6. **Debugging**: Set breakpoints and use the "Run and Debug" view to start a debugging session, stepping through code, inspecting variables, etc.

## Some popular Python debuggers available for use in Visual Studio Code

Both environments offer rich features for running and debugging Python code, catering to different preferences and workflows.

In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), several popular Python debuggers can be used to help developers find and fix issues in their code. The primary debugger is integrated into the Python extension for VS Code, but there are also other tools and extensions that can enhance debugging capabilities. Here are some of the key options:

1. **Python Debugger (pdb)**: Integrated into Python itself, `pdb` is accessible in VS Code through the Python extension. It allows setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and evaluating expressions.

2. **Visual Studio Code Python Extension**: This extension, officially provided by Microsoft, integrates with `pdb` and offers a rich debugging experience directly within VS Code, including a graphical interface for the debugger, configurations for different debugging scenarios, and more.

3. **Debugpy**: An open-source Python debugger package, `debugpy` allows debugging Python code remotely and is the backend for the Python extension's debugging capabilities in VS Code. It supports a wide range of Python versions and can be used for complex debugging scenarios, including remote debugging.

4. **PyDev.Debugger**: Part of the PyDev project (primarily known for the PyDev IDE for Eclipse), this debugger can also be used in VS Code through appropriate configuration. It offers capabilities similar to `pdb` but is designed to work well with the PyDev environment.

5. **Extensions for Specific Frameworks**: For Python developers working with specific frameworks (like Django, Flask, or Pyramid), there are extensions and configurations within the Python extension for VS Code that tailor the debugging experience to those frameworks, making it easier to debug applications built with them.

These tools and extensions make VS Code a powerful environment for debugging Python code, catering to a wide range of development and debugging needs.

## Some popular Python code editors other than Spyder and Visual Studio Code

Other than Spyder and Visual Studio Code, several popular Python code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) cater to different preferences and needs. Here are some notable ones:

1. **PyCharm**: Developed by JetBrains, PyCharm is a highly popular IDE for Python development, offering a rich set of features including debugging, intelligent code completion, code inspections, project navigation, and a wide range of plugins for various Python frameworks.

2. **Sublime Text**: A versatile and fast text editor that supports Python programming through syntax highlighting, snippets, and plugins. It's known for its speed and efficiency, as well as its powerful customization options.

3. **Atom**: Developed by GitHub, Atom is a modern, approachable, and hackable text editor that's fully customizable in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports Python development through community packages that add functionalities like auto-completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting.

4. **Jupyter Notebook**: Particularly popular in data science and academic research, Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive computing environment where you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots, and rich media.

5. **Thonny**: Aimed at beginners, Thonny is a simple Python IDE with features that help novices get started with programming. It includes a debugger, a simple interface for creating and running Python scripts, and tools to help understand how Python code executes.

6. **Eclipse with PyDev**: Eclipse is a powerful open-source IDE that, when combined with the PyDev plugin, supports Python development. It offers features like debugging, code completion, and project management.

7. **Emacs with Python-mode**: Emacs is a highly customizable text editor that, with the addition of Python-mode, becomes a powerful environment for Python development. It supports executing Python code, debugging, and navigating through code projects.

8. **Vim with Python plugins**: Vim, being a highly configurable text editor, can be turned into a Python IDE with the right set of plugins. It's favored by many developers for its speed, efficiency, and the powerful editing capabilities it offers.

Each of these editors and IDEs has its unique set of features and advantages, catering to different aspects of Python development, from writing simple scripts to developing large-scale applications.
